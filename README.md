There probably a lot of antipatterns used so don't use it as a repo to learn from.

Missing:
- Direct messages
- Edit user profile
- User avatars
- Mentions
- Edit channel
- Edit message
- Read/Unread
- Attachments
- Channel participants
- Public/Private channels

Out of scope:
- Security considerations
- Best practises :)
